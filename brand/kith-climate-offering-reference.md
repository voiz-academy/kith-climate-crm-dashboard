## The Core Narrative

**Climate skills are being transformed by AI.** 70% of job skills will change by 2030, and AI is the primary driver. Climate professionals who can build with AI will define the next era of sustainability work.

**The market is flooded with AI courses that don't work.** Video lectures, quizzes, certificates—the same pedagogy from 2015, applied to 2025's most important topic. Everyone teaches AI, but almost nobody uses AI to teach.

**Kith Climate is AI-native.** Participants don't watch videos about AI. They build real deliverables using Claude Code. The tool that signals how consulting, analysis, and reporting will get done.

**The outcome isn't a certificate—it's a portfolio.** Five real deliverables. Real climate problems solved. More valuable than any credential.

## Key Messaging

### The Lead Line

> "AI will reshape climate work. Will you be ahead of it?"

### The Hook

Claude Code signals how consulting, analysis, and reporting will get done. Six weeks, five real deliverables, a system you'll use for years. Master Claude Code—build real deliverables you use the day after the program ends.

### Supporting Messages

| Angle | Message |
|-------|---------|
| **Outcome** | "Graduate with 5 real deliverables, not a certificate" |
| **Accessibility** | "No coding experience needed—Claude Code handles the technical complexity" |
| **Differentiation** | "Build real deliverables with Claude Code, not watch videos about AI" |
| **Proof** | "100+ climate professionals trained. 400+ deliverables shipped." |
| **Stakes** | "The window is open. It won't stay open." |
| **Urgency** | "AI will reshape climate work. Will you be ahead of it?" |

### Phrases to Use

## Objection Handling

### "I can't code. Will I really be able to build apps?"

> Yes. No coding experience needed. Claude Code handles the technical complexity—you focus on climate problems and refine the outputs.

### "How does this compare to other programs?"

> Only Kith Climate combines AI and climate upskilling, placing you in the role of solution builder and user. Others stop at knowledge. We continue until you have real deliverables and experience using them. This isn't a mass cohort with 100+ enrolled and guest speakers.

### "Is this a new program?"

> We launched mid-2025 and have trained 100+ climate professionals who've shipped 400+ deliverables. Same proven method, now focused on Claude Code as the key platform.

### "$2,450 feels expensive."

> A certificate costs $500 and sits on a shelf. This produces 5 client-ready deliverables you can demo in interviews, use in your current role, and add to your portfolio. The difference in career outcomes justifies the investment many times over. Employer reimbursement documentation is available.

### "I don't have 5-7 hours per week."

> Two live sessions (2.5 hours total) plus building time. Most participants fit it around a full-time job. The key is consistency across 6 weeks, not intensity. Intensive, but contained.

### "What if I fall behind?"

> Async Discord support, peer collaboration, and live sessions are recorded. Most participants stay on track because the weekly rhythm is manageable and the deliverables are immediately useful.
