# Kith Climate Website Briefing

## Project Overview

Build a new marketing website for **Kith Climate** at kithclimate.com. This is a from-scratch build for a rebrand launching January 21, 2026.

**Primary conversion goal:** Free workshop registrations
**Secondary conversion goal:** Direct consultation bookings

---

## Brand Context

### What Kith Climate Is

Kith Climate trains climate professionals to build AI applications. It's a consumer-facing vertical under Kith AI Lab (enterprise parent company).

**Not a course company—a capability company.** Participants don't watch videos about AI. They build real deliverables using Claude Code during live sessions.

### The Differentiator

> "The only AI training platform actually built with AI."

The market irony: everyone teaches AI, but almost nobody uses AI to teach. Competitors (Terra.do, DeepLearning.AI, Coursera-style platforms) use legacy LMS—video lectures, quizzes, certificates. 2015 pedagogy, 2025 topic.

Kith Climate uses Claude Code—the tool that signals how consulting, analysis, and reporting will get done.

### Brand Architecture

| Entity | Role | URL |
|--------|------|-----|
| Kith AI Lab | Parent company, enterprise B2B | kithailab.com |
| Kith Climate | Consumer B2C vertical | kithclimate.com |
| kith | Core builder technology | (internal) |

Footer should include: "Part of Kith AI Lab"

## Visual Language

**Style:** Teal-tinted dark palette, grid texture, monospace labels. "Linear, not Terminal."

**Why not green/earthy:** The audience already has climate motivation. They're not asking "should I care about climate?" They're asking "will this work?" and "is this serious?"

Traditional climate education looks like: green palette, earth imagery, "join the movement." That's table stakes. The Kith visual language signals: professional, technical, outcome-oriented.

**Note:** Claude Code already has brand guidelines with specific colors, typography, and design tokens.

## Messaging Layers

### Layer 1: Headline (Hero)
> "AI will reshape climate work. Will you be ahead of it?"

This is the hook. Everyone sees it. It creates pause.

### Layer 2: The How
> "Claude Code signals how consulting, analysis, and reporting will get done. Six weeks, five real deliverables, a system you'll use for years."

For the curious—those who want to understand why it's different.

### Layer 3: The Proof
> "400+ deliverables shipped. 100+ professionals trained. See what they built."

For the "show me" crowd.

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Climate professionals already working in sustainability roles—sustainability managers, ESG analysts, carbon accountants, supply chain sustainability leads, climate consultants.

**What they're asking:**
- Will this work?
- Will this help me get hired / advance?
- Is this serious or another feel-good climate thing?
- Can I actually do this if I can't code?

**What they're NOT asking:**
- Should I care about climate? (They already do)
- What is AI? (They know, they're trying to use it)

## Program Details

### Structure
- **6 weeks**, cohort-based, live + async support
- **Monday (1 hour):** Live build session
- **Tuesday–Thursday:** Independent refinement with async Discord support
- **Friday (90 min):** Demo session—present work, receive feedback, peer learning
- **Primary tool:** Claude Code

### Weekly Topics & Deliverables
1. **Setup + Fundamentals** → CLAUDE.md configuration and folder structure
2. **Data Audit** → Data quality memo with recommendations
3. **Carbon Inventory** → Interactive emissions dashboard (Scope 1/2/3)
4. **Materiality + Initiatives** → Materiality matrix and reduction roadmap
5. **Tracking Dashboard** → Progress tracking system with variance analysis
6. **Disclosure Narrative** → TCFD/CSRD-aligned capstone document

### Time Commitment
5-7 hours/week. Two live sessions (2.5 hours total) plus time to build and refine deliverables.

### Price
$2,450 for the 6-week cohort program.

### Next Cohort

### Outcome
Participants graduate with 5 client-ready deliverables, a working Claude Code system (CLAUDE.md, playbooks, folder structure), and the ability to solve new problems fast. More valuable than a certificate.

## Objection Handling (FAQ)

**"I can't code. Will I really be able to build apps?"**
Yes. If you can write an email, you can build these apps. The AI handles all technical complexity.

**"How does this compare to other programs?"**
Only Kith Climate combines AI and climate upskilling, placing you in the role of solution builder and user. Others stop at knowledge. We continue until you have working tools and real experience using them.

**"Is this a new program?"**
Launched mid-2025, trained 100+ climate professionals who've built impressive solution portfolios. Same proven method, now enhanced to be even more climate-specific.
